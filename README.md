**Perform end-to-end data analysis to gain efficient data insight**

## What is this book about?
Go is the perfect language for machine learning; it helps to clearly describe complex algorithms, and also helps developers to understand how to run efficient optimized code. This book will teach you how to implement machine learning in Go to make programs that are easy to deploy and code that is not only easy to understand and debug, but also to have its performance measured. 

This book covers the following exciting features: 
* Set up a machine learning environment with Go libraries
* Use Gonum to perform regression and classification
* Explore time series models and decompose trends with Go libraries
* Clean up your Twitter timeline by clustering tweets
* Learn to use external services for your machine learning needs
